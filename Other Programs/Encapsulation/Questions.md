### User.java Question

The "User" class represents a user on a ‘buy and stream’ movie platform
with attributes :
name, age, account balance. The “Movie” class represents a movie on the
platform with
attributes: Movie Title, AgeRestriction, Cost of the movie. The User class
should have a
method to check whether he can watch a movie based on his age and also
account balance. The User class should also have a method to WatchMovie where he has to
pay the cost for
the Movie to watch it. The Movie class should have methods to get Cost
and Age restriction. The main method should create objects of the "User" and "Movie" classes
and demonstrate
the use of their methods. Input should be taken from the user

### Line.java & Lines.java Question
Given a class Line with slope, y-intercept, x1, y1, x2, y2 as attributes, write 3
constructors for equations for the line given Slope-y-intercept, Slope Point and two
Point forms
Slope-y-intercept:
y = mx + c
Slope point form:
y - y1 = m(x - x1)
Two Point form:
(y - y1) / (y1 - y2) = m(x - x1) / (x1 - x2)
Also, m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
Each constructor should display the appropriate Line equation.
